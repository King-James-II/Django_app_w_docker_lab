# Django Project README

## Introduction
Welcome to my Django project! This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in Django development. In this lab, I have created my first Django project, first Django app, and first Django view to return a simple HTML page. Additionally, I have learned to create a Docker image of my app, which makes it simple to share and run it on any computer.

## Project Structure
- **firstproject**: This directory contains the Django project settings and configurations.
- **firstapp**: This directory contains the Django app, including views, models, and templates.
- **Dockerfile**: This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image for the Django project.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
4. Activate the virtual environment.
5. Install dependencies.

1. Run the Django development server.
2. Access the project in your web browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Building Docker Image

Enjoy exploring the Django project!
